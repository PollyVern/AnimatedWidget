# AnimatedWidget on LockScreen
# From task to AppStore release
## Task
Add a widget with animation effects to the LockedScreen

## Problems
1. Apple does not provide methods to add animation of a format such as gif to the code
2. By timer to achieve the program method of changing images - does not work
3. There was a possible option to change the static picture through the API every second, but by doing so it loads the back, processor and apple rejects the apps. This solution doesn't work
